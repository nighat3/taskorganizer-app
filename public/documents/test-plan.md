**Design Plan for Task Organizer App**

The user-testing of this application must comprehensively test both usability of the app and whether or not the features of the app met the client's original needs.

This task organizer app aims to achieve a few key goals when it comes to implementing features:

    -Display tasks _visibly_.

    -Allow for prioritization.

    -Allow for collaboration,

    -Subtle reminder of an upcoming deadline.

On the other hand, the task organizer app aims to create a seamless and intuitive user experience where users easily follow the design and layout of the UI.

-To test the app in both areas, we can conduct user testing from a sample of users who are students, professors, and administrators. I believe a combination of scenario-reviews and user-testing would be most effective. These users can belong to different age groups and genders, but must share some similarities with the client to gauge the effectiveness of the design for a certain kind of user. For example, many of the users being tested might like sticky notes, have a hectic schedule with a lot fo responsibilities to juggle, and have a need to organize their priorities.

**Scenarios:**
I am using examples of real personas to help me better understand how to step into the shoes of the user. Using these personas, we can find a groupd of individuals who would make ideal user testers. Additionally, I would plan to keep communication with users open, informal, and pertinent to their daily lives so that they might respond more thoughtfully.

1. Poppy Smith

   _A third-year student at a university_

   Poppy has to juggle academics, recruitment for internships, and extracurricular commitments all at once. She needs an effective way to organize her life's many priorities before exams arrive next month!

   Scenario for Poppy: _Suppose your student government organization is meeting sometime this week, you have two separate group projects in two of your classes, one assignment due, AND you have 2 interviews lined up as well. To ensure that you don't write these commitments down and forget about them, you need some sort of a tool to organize your deadlines and commitments._

   Task for Poppy: You want to be sure that you're notified of the most immediate task first. Set a task that is high priority.
   Task for Poppy: Your interviews are scheduled for the same day. Make sure they are not happening during the same time.

   **Notes**:

   Functionality-wise: This scenario would provide insights about younger age-groups and how younger users might perceive and use the Task Organizer differently from adult or elderly users.

   Feature-wise: This scenario will also test the App's ability to consolidate different tasks while managing to keep them distinct enough and noticeable.

2. Ryan Scott

   _An Information Science professor at a university_

   Amongst his students, research, teaching, meetings with the department, monthly conferences and more, Ryan rarely finds the time to sit down and create calendar events in his phone one by one. He needs a simple and fast way to log his long list of tasks. He wants to be able to see the "bottom-line" of what needs to be done and when it needs to be done by.

   Scenario for Ryan: _It turns out that you were invited to visit California and speak at a university there next week. However, before you can go, you need to update your teaching staff on what to do in your absence, grade some assignments that were handed in last week, hold office hours, and also continue to be present at department meetings. How can you organize these commitments from different facets of your life in a place where they are neatly separated, prioritized by importance, but not leave your sight? You need something to help with better remembering all of the moving parts to your schedule without confusing or losing any fast-approaching or distant deadlines!_

   Task example for Ryan: Before you go to California, you need to check whether or not you are available during the grading session on the upcomign Wednesday at 5.

**Notes**:

Functionality-wise: This scenario will provide insights into usability for a non-student age group.

Feature-wise: More importantly, this scenario might highlight (or dampen) the app's ability to document many different overlapping tasks even as they continue to be worked on.

3. Vicky Muller

   _A high school administrator_

   Since her vacation is fast approaching, Vicky will be stretched thin as an administrator as she helps teachers log grades, helps the senior class organize their school trip, meets with students daily,and plans her own trip (which is only 7 days away).

   Scenario for Vicky: _Suppose that you're juggling all of your responsibilities in this one particularly stressful week and you have missed a deadline or two already. You cannot afford to miss more deadlines, but it is becoming very difficult to keep track of all of them at once. You seek help from the Task Organizer App to separate what is imperative to finish before you head to the Bahamas from what can wait to be done until after you get back. Additionally, you also want to see tasks that you have completed so hat you can cross them off your list._

   Task example for Vicky: Monitoring your completed tasks is important to you. Look at your Task Board to see what tasks have you already completed.

**Notes**:

Feature-wise: This scenario will put to the test the app's ability to remind its users frequently and persistently enough so that no deadlines are missed. Additionally, it will also test how effecive the 3 sections (high priority, medium/low priority, and completed tasks) of the app's second screen are in helping users organize their tasks more effectively.
